*DOMAIN:* PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION:* 4 WEEKS

*DESCRIPTION:* This Python program is like having a helpful assistant who can take your spreadsheet data, analyze it, and create a professional PDF report - all with just a few lines of code! Whether you're a student, business owner, or researcher, this tool makes data analysis accessible to everyone.

*IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:*
   1. Reading Your Data
   The program starts by opening your CSV file (that's the read_data() function). Think of this like opening a spreadsheet in    Excel:
     - It carefully checks if the file exists (so you don't get confusing errors)
     - It reads all the rows and columns into memory
     - It handles any problems gracefully (like missing files or strange formatting)

  2. Analyzing the Numbers
     Next (analyze_data() function), it looks through all your numbers to find:
       - How many records there are (rows in your spreadsheet)
       - Which columns contain numbers (it automatically skips text columns)
       - The average, minimum, and maximum for each numeric column

  3. Creating the PDF Report
     Now for the impressive part (generate_pdf_report() function). Using the FPDF library, it:
       - Creates a title page with the report date
       - Adds a summary section showing key statistics
       - Includes detailed analysis of each numeric column
       - Shows sample data (first 10 rows) in a neat table
       - Saves everything as a professional PDF file

*KEY FEATURES:*
  1. Automatic Type Detection
  The program automatically figures out which columns contain numbers - you don't have to tell it!

  2. Error Handling
  If something goes wrong (like a missing file), it explains the problem instead of crashing.

  3. Clean PDF Formatting
  The report uses:
    - Different font sizes for headings vs. text
    - Proper spacing between sections
    - Borders around the data table
    - Page breaks when needed

  4. Flexible Design
  It works with almost any CSV file because it:
    - Doesn't assume specific column names
    - Handles different numbers of columns
    - Adapts to various data types

*STEPS TO USE THIS PROGRAM:*
  1. Prepare your data as a CSV file (you can export from Excel or Google Sheets)
  2. Save it as "sample_data.csv" in the same folder as the program
  3. Run the program (just type python report_generator.py)
  4. Open the PDF ("analysis_report.pdf") to see your results!

*Technical Components Used:*
  1. CSV Module - For reading spreadsheet data
  2. FPDF Library - For creating PDF documents
  3. Datetime - To timestamp the reports
  4. Basic Python - For all the analysis logic

*LEARNING OUTCOMES:*
  - How to work with real-world data files
  - Basic statistical operations in Python
  - PDF generation (useful for many professional applications)
  - Error handling and defensive programming
  - Function organization and code structure

*OUTPUT:*
